* Current issues
** DONE add ability to login
   google auth is a must
	 using auth0
	 callback to /callback and then redirect to main page /
** DONE Check to renew login session
	 using localStorage
** TODO add ability to save favorite foods
*** TODO update Flask app with database
		think about using elixir for the API, could be fun

		need to figure out how auth0 works for individual users ->
		independent token?

		auth0 gives unique user_id, can use this
		[https://auth0.com/docs/users/normalized/auth0/identify-users](auth0
		unique users)
		
		already have one db table of all foods, need to add a second table
		of users and favorite foods
		
		db table will probably look something like this:
		
		| User_ID | Food       |
		|---------+------------|
		|     123 | Applesauce |
		|     123 | Yogurt     |
		|     124 | Applesauce |

		store user foods
		
		need to think about storing ALL foods so allow for users to
		select only favorites that actually exist

		either that or just search the list of foods for matches but that
		seems like it might get slow and also inaccurate and probably
		confusing
		
		Don't want to have the user be responsible for making sure their
		foods comply with the DH format.

		Depends on what is more frustrating i guess: only being able to
		choose foods that the app has seen as a favorite or not finding
		the correct food when it is actually in the dining hall.
		
**** TODO add API request from front end to save the foods
		
		need to evaluate this


*** TODO add ability to enter and save favorite foods
		need new component
		send API post request to the Flask App
		
		need to think about how this should work
		problem is that the food they type might not exactly match the
		foods in the dh menu
		
		can save whatever you want, then need to "search" to see a list of
		foods that might be in the dh that day that you like
		
		need a list and textbox
		save button, search button
		tabbed interface, favorites, results
		
		need to save to higher level component, don't keep in favorites
		component because then the list will reset everytime
		
		db already has the ability to give all foods
		adding a favorite should search this list, that should be loaded
		on page load, shouldn't be too slow
		
		makes favorites really easy to deal with

** TODO api requests break on github pages
   figure out how to proxy that
	 pretty strange issue not seeing a lot of help online
	 need more research into this
** TODO fix navbar width
   screen scrolls to the right when it shouldn't
	 looks like i need to add border-right-10px or so
** DONE mobile formatting 
	 looks pretty good rn tbh
	 maybe just add more padding in the future if we really need it
** DONE update favicon and page title
** TODO fix security problems with dependencies
	 update to newest versions of at risk packages
